# Binaries for programs
# For development it is recommended to build programs in place.
# For production use a separate build directory, for example 'bin/'.
#
# If you only want to ignore the built executables you can add
# something like:
#
# myprogram
deployr-runner.exe
#
# If you want to ignore all of the built executables in the current
# directory you can add:
#
# /*
# !/*.go
# !/*.mod
# !/*.sum

# Binaries for programs
*.exe
*.exe~
*.dll
*.so
*.dylib

# Test binary, can be ignored
*_test
